git push -u origin master
# 1. Send commits from a local branch 'master' to the branch
#    called the same on a remote repository 'origin'.
#    If master does not exist remotely, it will be created.
# 2. The option -u (or --set-upstream) means the following:
#    if the current push succeeds, make the local branch 'master'
#    track its remote counterpart.
#    (learn about tracking in 'tracking remote branches' on the
#     current page)
