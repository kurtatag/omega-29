# In the situation mentioned above we have to:

# step 1
git fetch
# to get origin/master in sync with the remote server

# step 2
git merge origin/master
# If any merge conflicts, we would need to fix those just like we do with the
# normal merge conflicts. But in most cases we don't even get conflicts, we
# just simply have to do the merge in order to send it to the remote server.

# step 3
git push
# now the remote server will accept our push
