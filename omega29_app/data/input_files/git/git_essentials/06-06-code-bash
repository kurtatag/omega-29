git ls-tree <tree-ish>
# show the file structure of Repository at that point (similar to /bin/ls)

# examples:
git ls-tree HEAD
git ls-tree master
git ls-tree master my-folder/ # we can specify a directory to look inside it
git ls-tree HEAD^ # one commit back
git ls-tree master^

# Everything in that structure is a tree or a blob:
# blob   = file
# tree   = directory

# A tree-object is a tree-ish itself, we can use its SHA (or part of it) to
# look inside it:
git ls-tree 6fa98b8493af8
