git fetch origin
# 1. Fetch (or download) all branches and tags from the specified remote.
# 2. Update all remote-tracking branches for the specified remote
#    (in our case for 'origin' those would be branches like origin/master,
#     origin/develop, origin/feature/my_feature...)
# 3. Our local branches will not be updated.

git fetch
# if we have only one remote repository
