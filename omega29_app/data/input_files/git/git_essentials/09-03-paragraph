Stash   - a place where we can store changes temporarily without having
          to commit them to Repository

Stash is not part of Repository, Staging Index or Working Directory,
it's a special fourth area in Git, separate from the others.

The things that we put into Stash aren't commits. They are snapshots of
the changes that we were in the process of making (they don't have a SHA).
