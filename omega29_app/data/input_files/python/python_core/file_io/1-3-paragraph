  'r'       open for reading (DEFAULT)
  'w'       open for writing, truncating the file first
  'x'       open for exclusive creation, failing if the file already exists
  'a'       open for writing, appending to the end of the file if it exists
  'b'       binary mode
  't'       text mode (DEFAULT)
  '+'       open a disk file for updating (reading and writing)

We must have exactly one of create/read/write/append mode and at most one plus.

The mode 'w+' opens and trancates the file to 0 bytes.
The modes 'r+' and 'a+' open the file without trancation.
