Scopes are contexts in which named references can be looked up.

There are four scopes in Python:
    Local      - Inside the current function
    Enclosing  - Any and all enclosing functions
    Global     - Top-level of a module
    Built-in   - Provided by the builtins module

Important:
Blocks of code demarkated by indentation do not create their own
scopes (for loops, while loops etc)
