sudo apt install xinetd
# inetd (internet service daemon) is a super-server daemon on many Unix
# systems that provides Internet services. For each configured service,
# it listens for requests from connecting clients. Requests are served by
# spawning a process which runs the appropriate executable, but simple
# services such as echo are served by inetd itself. External executables,
# which are run on request, can be single- or multi-threaded.
# First appearing in 4.3BSD,[1] it is generally located at /usr/sbin/inetd.
# In recent years, because of the security limitations in the original design
# of inetd, it has been replaced by xinetd.

systemctl status xinetd
# check the status of xinetd.service
