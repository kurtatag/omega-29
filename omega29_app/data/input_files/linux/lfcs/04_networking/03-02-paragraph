Firewalls in Linux, in general, all function within, and because of,
the existence of something called Netfilter, which is the networking guts
of the Linux kernel. But you can't directly configure Netfilter, so you
need some tools to get in there and make things work. After years of
foundational technology coming to life and passing away, today, we have
two conflicting demons, that both can be used to make Netfilter do its
firewalling thing. One is called Iptables, the other is called Firewalld.
Iptables has been around longer, but, as such, even though you can still
install it and run it, you may find it becomes deprecated in the near
future, so you might not want to use it. Firewalld is relatively newer.
It functions on a different security metaphor, and in certain ways,
can be thought of as easier to configure. Iptables and Firewalld cannot,
however, run at the same time, on the same system.

Ubuntu uses a user-friendly frontend to manage the iptables rules. This tool
is called ufw for uncomplicated firewall. And compared to writing rules for
iptables, it is fairly uncomplicated.

firewalld is used in the following Linux distributions as the default
firewall management tool:
  - RHEL 7, CentOS 7
  - Fedora 18 and newer
  - Available for several other distributions
