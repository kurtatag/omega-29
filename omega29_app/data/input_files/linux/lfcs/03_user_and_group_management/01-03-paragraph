A line from /etc/passwd file:
scott:x:1000:1000:scott,,,:/home/scott:/bin/bash

Expanation of the line:
[username] : [x] : [uid] : [gid] : [comment] : [home folder] : [default shell]

[username]       - what we type to login and that can be up to 32 characters
                   long with no spaces
[x]              - This represents the fact that the user's password is stored
                   in the shadow file. Shadow is only readable by root and
                   members of the shadow group and only root can write to it.
[uid]            - User ID, the numeric representation of the user.
                   Typically, normal users start at number 1,000 and go up
                   from there as you add more users. The root user has user ID
                   zero and system accounts start from there.
[gid]            - Group ID, the numeric representation of the user's primary
                   group. A user can be a member of more than one group but
                   the primary group is listed here. And the others are listed
                   in the group file
[comment]        - A description or comment field. Usually this is where
                   a human friendly name is stored like a full first and last
                   name.
[home folder]    - The path to the user's home directory where their stuff
                   is stored and where they'll start out when they log into
                   the system at the command line.
[default shell]  - The user's default shell.
                   Usually it'll be set to bash but for some accounts that
                   aren't permitted to login it'll be set to 'no login' or
                   'false'.
