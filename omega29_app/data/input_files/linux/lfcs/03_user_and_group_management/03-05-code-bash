sudo usermod -a -G finance bob
# to add user 'bob' to a supplementaty group 'finance'
# -a  = Add the user to the supplementary group(s). Use only with the -G option.
# -G  = A list of supplementary groups which the user is also a member of. Each
#       group is separated from the next by a comma, with no intervening
#       whitespace. The groups are subject to the same restrictions as the group
#       given with the -g option.
#       If the user is currently a member of a group which is not listed, the
#       user will be removed from the group. This behaviour can be changed via
#       the -a option, which appends the user to the current supplementary group
#       list.
