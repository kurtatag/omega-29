Logical Volume Management (LVM):
    - is an additional layer of management on top of standard partitions
    - while it uses standard partitions, usually on a GPT disk, LVM thinks
      about the storage as volumes and groups
    - it gives us the ability to span a filesystem across multiple disks
    - LVM first divides space into PVs (or physical volumes), which are
      standard partitions, but are treated a little differently
    - these PVs become members of a VG (or volume group), an organizational
      unit that keeps track of the underlying volumes
    - on top of volume groups we have LVs (or logical volume), which contain
      the filesystems that we use
