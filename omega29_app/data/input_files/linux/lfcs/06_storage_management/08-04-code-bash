# Let's make a disk /dev/sdb automatically mount when we need it, rather
# than keeping it mounted all the time.

vi /etc/auto.master
# add at the end of the file the following line:
# /misc /etc/auto.misc
#
# /misc           = where we expect the device to be (mountpoint), we don't
#                   want to use /mnt because we don't want autofs to take
#                   over our regular mount
# /etc/auto.misc  = a path to a file where I'll provide more information
#                   about the volume that will get mounted (a file that
#                   already exists)

vi /etc/auto.misc
# add the following line to the file:
# disk1   -fstype=ext4    :/dev/sdb
#
# disk1     = a name that will be part of a mountpoint (for example /misc/disk1)
# /dev/sdb  = a name of the our disk (filesystem) we want to mount

systemctl restart autofs
# since we made changes to the configuration files

df -h
# let's first make sure that our device isn't mounted

cd /misc/disk1
# let's go to our disk (which should mount automatically)

df -h
# now let's make sure that our device is mounted


# We could do the same thing for a remote mount too (CIFS/SMB/NFS).
# For example:
vi /etc/auto.misc
# remote   -fstype=cifs,username=name,password=pwd    :\\server\share
# remote   -fstype=nfs                                server:\share
