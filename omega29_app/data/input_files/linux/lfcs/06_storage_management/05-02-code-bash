# filesystems can mount at boot time due to this file
# (fstab = filesystem table)

man fstab
# to understand what fields mean on each line in /etc/fstab
# 1st field describes the block device (filesystem), UUID is prefered here
# 2nd field describes where you want to mount the filesystem
# 3rd field describes the filesystem type we're going to use
# 4th field describes the mount options associated with the filesystem
# 5th field desribes whether the filesystem needs to be dumped
# 6th field describes the order in which filesystem checks are done at reboot
#     time (root filesystem should be 1, others - 2)

# to get the UUID for disks

vi /etc/fstab
# UUID="0f790447-ebef-4ca0-b229-d0aa1985d57f"  /mnt/myfs  defaults  ext4  0  2
# adding the above line to /etc/fstab is all it takes to mount a filesystem
# at boot time
