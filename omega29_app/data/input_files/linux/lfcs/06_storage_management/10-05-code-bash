# If we want to have a partition mounting with quota support
# automatically, we could do that in /etc/fstab like so:
vi /etc/fstab
# UUID=0f790447...   /mnt/myvolume   ext4   defaults,usrquota,grpquota   0 0

# We can also mount a partition temporarily with options that we need:
umount /nmt/myvolume  # let's first unmount our partition
mount -o quota,grpquota /dev/sdb /mnt/myvolume  # -o  = options
