# Reconfigure swap space


cat /proc/swaps
# to see where we currently have swap space and how it's being used

swapoff /dev/sda5
# to take the swap offline
# this aciton will also move data from the swap space back into RAM

dd if=/dev/zero of=/var/swapfile bs=1G count=8
# We will create a file that will hold pages swapped from memory by building
# a file full of zeros in the size that we want it to use, 8 GB.

chmod 600 /var/swapfile
# only root can read and write to this file

mkswap /var/swapfile
# this will turn our file into a usable swap file

swapon /var/swapfile
# to take the swap online
