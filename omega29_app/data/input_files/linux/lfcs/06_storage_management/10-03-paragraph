There's a few steps to getting a quota set up:
  1) We need to install the quota software if it's not installed.
  2) We need to mount our file system with support for quotas. They're
     disabled by default, so we need to edit our fstab file or autofs map
     to request support for quotas.
  3) We need to create the tables and files that the quota system needs in
     order to work.
  4) We need to specify what our quotas will be.
