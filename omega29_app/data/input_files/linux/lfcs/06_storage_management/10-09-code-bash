# Disk quotas for user bob (uid 1000):
#   Filesystem    blocks    soft    hard    inodes    soft    hard
#   /dev/sdb        0        1G      2G       0        0        0
#
# blocks  = how many blocks the user is taking up already on the file system
# soft    = a number where the user will get a warning, but they can still
#           continue to create files up until the hard limit
# hard    = where the system will prevent the user from consuming any more space
# (soft and hard limits can be expressed in blocks or bytes, kilobytes etc)
# (we can set limits in terms of inodes as well)
