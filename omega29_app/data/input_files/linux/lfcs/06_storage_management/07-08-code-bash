# getting rid of a RAID device:
# step 1:
umount /mnt/myraid  # unmount the filesystem
# step 2:
mdadm --stop /dev/md0  # tell mdadm to stop the array
# step 3:
mdadm --remove /dev/md0  # tell mdadm to remove the array
# step 4:
mdadm --zero-superblock /dev/sdb /dev/sdc /dev/sdd
# The disk are still marked as members of a RAID set. So, to fully restore
# them to unused partitions, we'll tell MDADM to zero the super block,
# where the information about what kind of device they are is stored.
