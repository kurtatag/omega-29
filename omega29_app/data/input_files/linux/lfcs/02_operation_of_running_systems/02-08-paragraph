It is possible to change the default runlevel at boot time.
While the system is booting hold down Shift to enter GRUB menu. Using
arrow keys get to *Ubuntu (first having chosen kernel
version). Then press 'e' to edit the commands before booting. Locate a line
with linux&lt;space&gt;... command and at the very end of the command add
&lt;space&gt;&lt;runlevel&gt;.
