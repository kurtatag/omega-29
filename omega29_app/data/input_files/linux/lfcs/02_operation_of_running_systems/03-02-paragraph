Booting the System:
  1. Firmware loads bootloader (from MBR or image)
  2. Bootloader loads kernel and initial file system
  3. Kernel mounts root file system
  4. Kernel starts systemd (Process Control Daemon), which controls all other
     processes on the system
  5. System boots to selected target level
