# remote_host  = we currently have access to it via ssh
# target_host  = we want access to it (but usually we don't)
#
# We specify target_host from the perspective of remote_host.
#
# So, this command will do the following:
#   1. open an ssh session to remote_host
#   2. set up port forwarding from our local machine to target_host
#   3. if we exit from an ssh session port forwarding will also stop
