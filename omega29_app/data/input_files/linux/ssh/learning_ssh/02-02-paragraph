If this is your first time connecting to the server you'll be asked to
accept the server's host key. When you accept it, the key will be stored
along with the server's name in a file "known_hosts" in the .ssh folder.
SSH uses this file to check the host key when you connect to a server and
if the server key changes for any reason you'll be notified. So if the
server key changes just open up the known_hosts file and delete the old key.
Then, when you reconnect you'll be prompted to accept the new key.
