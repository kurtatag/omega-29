packet filtering - (also referred to as static packet filtering)
controlling access to a network by analyzing the incoming and outgoing
packets and letting them pass or halting them based on the IP addresses
of the source and destination; packet filtering is one technique, among
many, for implementing security firewalls

Network Address Translation (NAT) is the process where a network device,
usually a firewall, assigns a public address to a computer (or group of
computers) inside a private network. The main use of NAT is to limit the
number of public IP addresses an organization or company must use, for
both economy and security purposes.
