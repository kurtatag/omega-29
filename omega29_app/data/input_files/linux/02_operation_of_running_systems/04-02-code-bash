#  TOP TERMINOLOGY:
#
#  load average  - how much work the system's processors have to do versus their
#                  ability to get it done
#                  -  1.00 = 100% of one processor core
#                  -  2.00 means either one core has twice as much work as it
#                     can handle or two cores are right at their full capacity
#                  -  it's important to know how many processor cores your
#                     system has for this number to have meaning
#                  -  the three numbers represent the load over the past minute,
#                     5 minutes and 15 minutes
#
#  tasks         - processes
#
#  %Cpu(s):
#  us            - user processes
#  sy            - system processes
#  ni            - niced processes
#  id            - processor's time spent idling
#  wa            - processor's time spent waiting for input/output operations
#  hi            - processor's time spent on hardware interrupts
#  si            - processor's time spent on software interrupts
#  st            - processor's time stolen by hipervisor (if you are using a
#                  virtual machine)
#
#  Mem:
#  buff/cache    - used by buffer or cache for a disk
#
#  Swap:
#  avail Mem     - how much memory is still available which would be used before
#                  swap is used
#
#  Table Columns:
#  PID           - process ID
#  USER          - user responsible for the process
#  PR            - priority, the relative importance of the process or an
#                  indication of how likely a process is to get access to
#                  processor resources in competition with others
#                  Priorities start at zero and go up from there, with lower
#                  numbers meaning a higher priority
#  NI            - NISEness of a process or a modifier on the real priority that
#                  can be set by the user. This scale goes from 19 to negative
#                  20. And here, the more negative a number is, the higher
#                  priority it confers on a process because adding the NISTness
#                  value to the regular priority moves it closer to zero if it's
#                  a negative number and further away from zero if it's
#                  positive.
#  VIRT          - virtual memory used
#  RES           - physical memory used
#  SHR           - shared memory used
#  S             - S means a process is sleeping, R means a process is running
#
#  COMMANDS:
#  h             - will bring up a fairly spartan help menu
#  q             - return back from the help menu
#  y             - toggle highlight for running (not sleeping) tasks
#  x             - toggle highlight for column which is currently the sort field
#  b             - to toggle the highlight, turned on by 'x' or 'y' from bold
#                  (which is difficult to see) to inverse
#  > or <        - to move the sorting column left or right
#  R             - to change the sort order of the column
#  q             - quit from top
