yum install httpd
# install Apache HTTP Server

yum install lynx
# install a text based browser "lynx"
# (we will use it to check that our web server is running properly)


systemctl enable httpd
systemctl start httpd
# enable and start our web server

lynx localhost
# check the the web server is running


# Now we would like to include virtual hosts from our own directory

vi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
# add at the bottom of file the following:
# IncludeOptional vhosts.d/*.conf

mkdir /etc/httpd/vhosts.d
# let's create the directory itself

systemctl restart httpd
# restart the service after having changed the configs
