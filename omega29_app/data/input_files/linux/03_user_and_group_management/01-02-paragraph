/etc/passwd    - The list of users is maintained in this file.
/etc/group     - The list of groups is maintained in this file.
/etc/shadow    - The list of encrypted passwords of users is maintained in
                 this file.

We don't edit these files directly, but instead we have a selection of tools
that let us create, modify and delete users and groups and find out
information about them.
