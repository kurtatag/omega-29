In order to use autofs, we need to create a map file that tells it which
mount to keep an eye on. The master map file, located at /etc/auto.master,
holds a listing of entries that effectively correspond to directories for
mount points and configuration files for them. These entries give us a path
that we can use to mount various volumes as they are needed.
