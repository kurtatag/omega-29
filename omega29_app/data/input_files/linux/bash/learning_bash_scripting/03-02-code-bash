touch file_{1,2,3}     # will produce 3 files
touch file_{1..3}      # will produce the same result as above
touch file_{01..100}   # will add zeros for correct order

echo {1..10..2}        # from 1 to 10 with step 2
echo {10..1}           # in reverse order

echo {a..z}            # works with letters too
echo {a..z..2}         # you can specify the interval with letters as well

echo {a..c}{1..3}      # you can chain these as well (will produce 9 words)
