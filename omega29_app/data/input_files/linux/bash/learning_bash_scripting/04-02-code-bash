greeting="hello"

echo $greeting, world \(planet\)!
# with no quotes everything gets interpreted (so we have to escape special
# characters we do not want to be interpreted)

echo '$greeting, world (planet)!'
# with single quotes we are dealing with a strong case - absolutely everything
# is considered a string

echo "$greeting, world (planet)!"
# with double quotes we have a middle way - variables are interpreted, the
# rest is considered a string
